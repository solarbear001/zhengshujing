      "**[Editor's Note]**",
      "The emergence of generative AI has brought humanity into a world where machine-generated content and human-original content are deeply intertwined.",
      "AIGC models like Sora and Midjourney have demonstrated humanity's imagination toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but have also flooded public spaces with fake imagery at unprecedented speed. Meanwhile, human identification capabilities lag far behind the pace of fabrication.",
      "Against this backdrop, 'using AI to identify AI' seems a viable approach: How does artificial intelligence define the boundaries of 'reality'? Can large models assist fact-checkers and readers in verification work?",
      "To this end, 'The Paper Fact Check' launched a challenge, putting popular models like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Doubao on the experimental bench.",
      "**Background**",
      "In February 2024, a Sora-generated video of 'cherry blossoms in snow' went viral online. The cherry blossom details were remarkably realistic, yet Google's Gemini 1.5 instantly identified it as AI-generated content.",
      "This case provided inspiration: perhaps we can rely on AI itself to identify AI videos.",
      "Based on this idea, we searched for large language models that can directly read video files. However, commercially available models with video parsing capabilities remain very limited. After screening, we ultimately chose Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-5 for testing.",
      "We prepared 12 videos for each model: 3 generated by different text-to-video models, 3 containing deepfake elements, 3 using computer-generated imagery (CGI), and 3 of real footage. For each video, we asked the same question: Is this video real footage, or was it produced through post-production? Does its content match what's claimed online?",
      "Through these questions, we wanted to explore not only the models' ability to identify fakes, but also what perspectives and logic they employ when drawing the line between 'real' and 'fictional.'",
      "**Fact Check**",
      "**The Line Between Real and Fictional**",
      "In fact-checking, a 'real' video typically means it's a live recording of the physical world we inhabit. Any imagery generated through computer technology, even if it contains highly realistic elements, is essentially fictional in nature.",
      "On this point, large models and fact-checkers share the same understanding. When we fed ChatGPT a video of 'a game simulating a Russian fighter landing on an aircraft carrier,' the model told us 'this video is computer-generated imagery (CGI) or post-production composite, not real-world footage.' When identifying footage of the 'January 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan,' the model stated, 'this video is real footage. No signs of AI generation, deepfake, or significant post-production compositing were found.'",
      "In testing, regarding the dimension of 'whether computer-generated imagery was used,' Gemini 2.5 Pro's performance was remarkable. It not only accurately identified nearly all 12 videos but could also distinguish between different computer technologies like AIGC and CGI. However, when identifying deepfake videos—such as 'American singer Taylor Swift speaking Chinese in an interview'—Gemini could detect that the video had been edited and that the audio was unusual, but couldn't explicitly identify the anomaly as originating from deepfake technology.",
      "In comparison, ChatGPT's performance was somewhat inferior, making relatively accurate judgments on only 7 of 12 videos and misidentifying all deepfake videos as 'real footage.' Additionally, ChatGPT doesn't deliberately distinguish between AI-generated and CGI content.",
      "**Thinking Like AI**",
      "Gemini isn't perfect, but it got all 12 questions right. How did it do it?",
      "Comparing Gemini and ChatGPT horizontally, one can observe that the two adopt vastly different analytical paths when facing the same video authenticity questions. If we personify the models, ChatGPT is like a lab technician, constantly citing technical terms like video resolution, frame rate, total frames, average image sharpness, noise levels, and edge density. Gemini, on the other hand, is like an experienced detective—examining visual details, cross-referencing video content with external sources, tracking technology timelines, and assessing production difficulty.",
      "For instance, when analyzing a Sora 2-generated video of 'Japanese citizens rallying for PM Sanae Takaichi,' ChatGPT concluded the video was 'post-production composited or AI-generated' based on technical dimensions like 'smooth image edges,' 'synthetic lighting characteristics,' 'overly stable inter-frame continuity,' and 'lack of real sensor noise structure.' Gemini, however, 'saw' that the video was 'entirely AI-generated' from clearly visible watermarks (and searched to understand their meaning), garbled text, and slightly unnatural human movements.",
      "ChatGPT's technical analysis approach has its advantages—it can discover abnormal details invisible to the human eye. However, ChatGPT's analytical method is difficult for ordinary people to replicate in daily life.",
      "Gemini's higher accuracy in judging video authenticity may precisely be because it abandoned blind faith in technical metrics and used more flexible, diverse judgment paths—paths that happen to coincide with how fact-checkers assess video authenticity daily.",
      "We summarized Gemini's analytical approach into 8 points for reference:",
      "1. Assess video quality: Are there issues with excessively low or inconsistent image quality?",
      "2. Observe details in key frames: Do foreground and background contradict each other? Is lighting natural? Are there common AI-generated video artifacts like garbled text?",
      "3. Examine dynamic continuity: During camera movement, does parallax between foreground and background follow physical world rules? Are there 'teleportation-style' camera movements?",
      "4. Audio detection: Does the sound harmonize with video content? Are there audio-visual sync issues or mismatches between voice and lip movements?",
      "5. Consider the real-world plausibility of events depicted. Does the technology shown exist in reality? Can objects in the video be found in real life? Does the scenario follow real-world logic?",
      "6. Reverse-search key frames, confirm when the video appeared, and check if social conditions at that time match the video's content.",
      "7. Consider production difficulty: Would it be harder or easier to achieve the same footage and camera work using AI or CGI compared to real filming?",
      "8. Search external sources to see if reports or other video materials can corroborate the tested video's content.",
      "**Afterword**",
      "On Gemini's interface, there's a conspicuous 'Show thinking' button decorated with a blue star. Admittedly, large models are black boxes—we cannot know whether their 'thinking' is true cognition or mere imitation. But even before the 'singularity moment' arrives, such 'thinking' is not without meaning.",
      "Two and a half years have passed, and models' ability to identify fakes has grown significantly, though still accompanied by hallucinations. In this sense, artificial intelligence may not just be an amplifier of information risks—it could also become a gatekeeper of information order. Whether detecting forged images, identifying generated videos, or tracing information sources, the intervention of models may give humanity more tools to combat misinformation. In the future, the real challenge may not be making machines think like humans, but letting them help humans see reality more clearly.",

      "《纽约时报》在2月底发布了一篇AI测试文章，对市面上10多款主流的AI检测工具识别AI生成图像和音视频的能力进行了测试。文章指出，尽管AI进步神速，但目前你还不能指望依靠AI检测工具来判断图像的真伪。",
      "这一结论与我们去年年底的观察基本一致：尽管学术界提出了许多检测方法，也不断有新论文发表，但在现实应用中，没有任何一款工具是完美的。",
      "一些工具的检测结果相对准确，并具备对多模态内容（图像、视频、音频）的识别能力，例如Gemini Pro和AI or Not。Sensity和Hive Detect的表现也算得上差强人意。但一些主流商业大模型，例如Claude和ChatGPT，在判断图像真伪方面的表现反而未达预期。",
      "这其中最令人费解的是Claude的表现——考虑到这是一款如此强调伦理的模型。但创造它的人好像完全没有考虑要让模型分辨得清真假这件事。这款模型在代码方面的能力表现出色，但AI的表现再次证明，模型的能力有不同的维度。在为数不多的8类真假图片测试中，Claude仅通过了“真实拍摄的图片（非AI生成）”这一项，其余的内容，不是判断错误，就表示无法检测。",
      "Claude在1月更新了它的constitution，强调要保持诚实并造福用户。我好奇，他们是否会将AI的核假能力作为指标纳入“诚实”的范畴。",
      "Gemini的表现要比Claude强得多。眼下一个更值得思考的问题是：为什么同样是AI模型，有些工具在识别AI生成内容方面的表现明显优于另一些？",
      "要回答这个问题，需要先理解这些AI检测工具是如何工作的。",
      "目前，大多数AI检测工具采用的是空域分析结合频域分析（frequency domain analysis）的技术路径。其核心思路是：真实图像与AI生成图像在频谱结构上存在差异。通过提取这些频谱特征，并训练一个二分类模型，就可以对图像进行真假判断。",
      "不同工具之间的性能差异，主要来自三个方面。",
      "首先是训练时使用的生成模型不同。有些检测工具基于GAN生成图像训练，有些基于Diffusion模型，还有些基于VAE模型。不同生成模型产生的图像特征不同，因此检测器学习到的判别特征也会不同。",
      "其次是机器学习过程中挖掘的图像的的特征类型不同。有些模型只依赖视觉特征，譬如噪点、伪影、边界混合、全局纹理一致性等。有些模型则会加入频率信息，通过频谱特征提高识别能力。还有一些方法会先对待检测图像进行重建，通过分析重建图与原图之间的差异，来捕捉生成模型的固有属性，从而获得更好的泛化能力。",
      "再者需要考虑的就是训练数据。比起早期AI模型批量生成的图像，那些使用经过对抗生成的、更难辨别的图像进行训练的模型会有更强的鲁棒性。",
      "这三个维度的差异，构成了不同工具识别能力差异的基础。如果一款工具在模型训练时覆盖的生成模型足够广、提取的特征足够有效、训练数据足够复杂，那么整体识别能力自然会更强。",
      "但频域分析本身存在一个天然缺陷：跨模型泛化能力较弱。",
      "例如，一款基于GAN-1模型训练的检测工具，在面对由Diffusion模型或升级后的GAN-2模型生成的图像时，识别准确率可能会显著下降。而现实情况是，用于生成AI图像的模型正在不断进化，新产品、新算法层出不穷。",
      "这意味着，面对海量、不断变化的AI生成图像，没有任何检测工具能够保证100%的准确率。同样的逻辑也适用于其他模态，例如文本和视频——依赖类似二分类思路的检测工具，也不可能做到完全准确。",
      "这时，有人提出了另一种思路：既然模型的学习能力无法泛化，那我们可不可以将问题简单化，在AI生成内容中嵌入永久标记，让检测系统只需寻找这些标记即可判断来源。",
      "Gemini Pro就是这么做的。该模型的母公司google本身就开发了大量文生图像模型，比如Veo, 并在其中嵌入了名为SynthID的水印技术。通过探查这些水印，Gemni Pro就能精准狙击由Google AI生成的图像。Google还将SynthID扩展到了更多内容类型，包括文本、音频和视频。",
      "这种方法有明显的局限性，那就是它只对Google自己的模型有效。其他生成式AI平台，例如Midjourney或Sora，并不会使用SynthID，因此Gemini无法检测这些来源的内容。",
      "但换个思路，如果能够建立统一的标准——例如所有AI公司都在生成内容中嵌入类似水印，或者建立类似互联网TCP/IP那样的通用协议，这个问题也能解决。",
      "事实上，科技公司已经在尝试这样做。Google在2024年加入了内容溯源与真实性联盟（C2PA）。这个联盟提出了一套开放技术标准，用于记录数字内容的来源与编辑历史。Meta、OpenAI、Adobe等公司都是该联盟成员。",
      "但这种方案仍然面临两个现实问题。首先你无法强制所有创造文生图像模型的公司都遵循同一标准，因为AI产业是全球性的，即便通过立法推动，也很难做到全面统一。",
      "其次，水印本身可以被移除或篡改。虽然当前的水印技术可以抵抗裁剪、缩放或滤镜处理，但对于具备技术能力的人来说，水印仍然可能被破解。",
      "为了应对这些问题，C2PA的成员正在开发更严格的内容溯源技术，以加强对篡改行为的防护。但无论如何，现阶段，水印还不能成为万能解决方案。",
      "就当下的AIGC技术进展而言，除了频域分析和水印技术之外，图像本身及其场外信息仍然是重要的判断依据，而且有时甚至比算法更直接。",
      "这些信息包括图像的内容是否符合解剖学和物理学规律，是否符合地理与社会背景，图像的来源与传播路径是否有AI痕迹、文件命名方式和元数据等是否能透露出AIGC模型的信息等等。这些也是专业事实核查员长期使用的技术路径。",
      "Gemini 3 Pro能够具备较为准确的图像识别能力，或许和它借鉴了这些技术路径有关。比如它可以注意到细微的AI视觉痕迹，诸如不符合物理规律的物体、异常光滑的“AI皮肤”等。同时，它还可以识别生成式AI常见的文件命名方式、可见水印，甚至一些AI应用添加的图标标记。",
      "尽管如此，我还是认为，无论AI检测工具如何发展，人类都不应该把判断真伪的最终决定权完全交给机器。",
      "因为工具无法做到100%准确，也就不可能100%可信。倘若人们全然依赖工具的判断，那不仅会导致独立思考能力的丧失，还可能制造冤假错案、导致信任危机。",
      "这并非杞人忧天。Reddit上曾出现过一个案例：有人花了几个小时撰写奖学金申请文，满怀希望提交后，却被系统标记为“AI生成”。没有证据，也没有解释，只有一个冷冰冰的自动标签——“你的内容不是真的”。",
      "类似的情况可能出现在所有内容创作领域。人们可能因为“写得太好”或“风格太明显”，而被怀疑使用AI。与此同时，生成式AI却可能凭借效率优势迅速占领内容生产领域。写作、绘画、编程、影视、音乐、视觉设计，都可能被AI深度介入。",
      "使用AI辅助创作本身并没有问题，但问题在于：我们能够接受到什么程度？我们是否愿意生活在一个信息来源模糊、所有内容都只有“90%概率是AI生成”的世界？",
      "至少，人类应当拥有识别内容创作者的能力，避免信息生产被少数技术主体垄断。但关键问题仍然是：How？",
      "这或许不仅仅是AI检测工具需要解决的问题，而是整个时代留给人类社会的一道难题。",
